# Advent of code
The idea of this repository is to track my completion on the Advent of codes. I start on 2021 and will go backwards (when I have time ðŸ˜€ )

## How to start and run
First install dependencies: ```yarn install```

Then, go to the year you want to look at and run:

```node index.js```
