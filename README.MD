# Advent of code
The idea of this repository is to track my completion on the Advent of codes. I started in 2021 and will go backwards (when I have time ðŸ˜€ )

## 2022 - Python - FINISHED - 50 stars

No need to build in python so let's run directly

### Init script for a new day

where ```<year>```is the year and ```<day>``` is the day you want to initialize the script for like : ```./pyaoc init 2022 13```

### Test a specific day
To test a specific day: ```./pyaoc test <year> <day>``` 

where ```<year>```is the year and ```<day>``` is the day you want to test the script for like : ```./pyaoc run 2022 13```

Reminder : input of the test goes into the input_test.txt file of each folder
