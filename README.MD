# Advent of code
The idea of this repository is to track my completion on the Advent of codes. I start on 2021 and will go backwards (when I have time ðŸ˜€ )

## How to start and run
First install dependencies: ```yarn install```

## Init a new day
To init a new day run: ```./aoc init <year> <day>```

## Run a specific day
To run a specific day: ```./aoc run <year> <day>```
