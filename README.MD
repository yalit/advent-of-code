# Advent of code
The idea of this repository is to track my completion on the Advent of codes. I started in 2021 and will go backwards (when I have time 😀 )

### Python

No need to build in python so let's run directly
### Init script for a new day
To init a new day run: ```./pyaoc init <year> <day>``` where ```<year>```is the year and ```<day>``` is the day you want to initialize the script for like : ```./pyaoc init 2022 13```

### Test a specific day
To test a specific day: ```./pyaoc test <year> <day>``` where ```<year>```is the year and ```<day>``` is the day you want to test the script for like : ```./pyaoc run 2022 13```

_Reminder_ : input of the test goes into the input_test.txt file of each folder

### Typescript

### How to start and run
First install dependencies: ```yarn install```

### Build the scripts
To build the scripts only : ```make build year=<year>``` where ```<year>```is the year you want to build for like : ```make build year=2021```

To build AND watch the scripts : ```make watch year=<year>``` where ```<year>```is the year you want to build for like : ```make watch year=2021```

### Init script for a new day
To init a new day run: ```./aoc init <year> <day>``` where ```<year>```is the year and ```<day>``` is the day you want to initialize the script for like : ```./aoc init 2021 13```

### Run a specific day
To run a specific day: ```./aoc run <year> <day>``` where ```<year>```is the year and ```<day>``` is the day you want to run the script for like : ```./aoc run 2021 13```
